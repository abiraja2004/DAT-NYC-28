EXERCISE: "Human Learning" with iris data

Can you predict the species of an iris using petal and sepal measurements?

TASKS:
1. Read the iris data into a pandas DataFrame, including column names.
2. Gather some basic information about the data.
3. Use groupby, sorting, and plotting to look for differences between species.
4. Write down a set of rules that could be used to predict species based on measurements.

BONUS: Define a function that accepts a row of data and returns a predicted species.
Then, use that function to make predictions for all existing rows of data.
